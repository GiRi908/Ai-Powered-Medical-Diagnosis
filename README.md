# AI-Powered Medical Diagnosis System

## 📌 Project Description
The **AI-Powered Medical Diagnosis System** leverages Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) to assist in diagnosing medical conditions based on patient symptoms, test results, and medical history. This system enhances **early disease detection**, reduces **human errors**, and supports **healthcare professionals** in making informed decisions.

## 🔬 Key Features
- ✅ **Symptom-Based Diagnosis** – Predicts possible diseases based on user-input symptoms.
- ✅ **Medical Image Analysis** – Uses Deep Learning to analyze X-rays, MRIs, and CT scans.
- ✅ **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** – Extracts insights from medical reports.
- ✅ **Electronic Health Records (EHR) Integration** – Utilizes past medical records for better predictions.
- ✅ **User-Friendly Interface** – Web-based UI for doctors, patients, and researchers.
- ✅ **Secure & Scalable** – Ensures patient data security and HIPAA compliance.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Programming Languages:** Python
- **Machine Learning Libraries:** TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-learn
- **Computer Vision:** OpenCV, CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks)
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** NLTK, SpaCy, Transformers
- **Database:** MySQL / Firebase
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React or Flask-based UI)
- **Deployment:** AWS / Google Cloud / Heroku
